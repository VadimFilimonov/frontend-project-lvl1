**Brain Games** is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

### Games
- Brain Even - definition of an even number
- Brain Calc - arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated
- Brain GCD - determination of the greatest common divisor
- Brain Progression - search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
- Brain Prime - definition of a prime number
